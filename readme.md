`COM_CODE`, the LPAT VCS synchronizer's github backend has been removed. Github repo will not receive any update. Use <https://6e5d.com/>.

Reasons:
* copilot steals code from your public repo and there is no way to stop it.
* github permanently locks your account if you are not willing to use 2FA.
