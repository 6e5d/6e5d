* I do not use git vcs or github. All projects here are mirrored by API. Use the email address to report any bug. The reply SMTP server must not have DKIM/SPF record check.
* All projects here are designed to build and run without installation, just download projects and dependencies in `.lpat/deps.txt` (recursively) in the same directory.
* For python projects, you need to implement a global `importer.importer(relative_path, __FILE__)` function to locate relative library. It can be easily implemented with the builtin importlib.
* For C projects, you can use the [nomake](https://github.com/6e5d/nomake) project(usage: `nomake <project_root>`) and it will automatically build all dependencies into shared library. You may have to generate some missing files(e.g. by wayland-scanner, glslc) manually. Hopefully everything will handled automatically in the future.
